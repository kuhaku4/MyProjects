My Programming Projects

UML Class Designer: https://github.com/mucsci-students/2024sp-420-JavaB
This project was done in Java for a software development class for college as a group project. I created a program that would allow you to create a UML class for databases with an interactable user interface as well as a CLI version.
I used Java, JSON, Spring Boot, and GitHub, in an agile development setting.
