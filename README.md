My Programming Projects

UML Class Designer: https://github.com/mucsci-students/2024sp-420-JavaB
This project was done in Java for a software development class for college as a group project. I created a program that would allow you to create a UML class for databases with an interactable user interface as well as a CLI version.
I used Java, JSON, Spring Boot, and GitHub, in an agile development setting.

Blog Website: https://github.com/kuhaku4/421Lab/tree/Lab7
This is a website I created for a web development class that used AWS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, NodeJS, REST API, and MEAN technologies to create a blog website.
The website was able to update in real-time, had user logins with secure passwords using salt and hash in MongoDB and user authentication using web tokens, and had an edit and delete function that was tied to the user that created the blog, which was hosted on AWS.
